<h1>CSCE 464 Website - Japanese Particle Practice Tool</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

This is a personal website I created for the semester-long project for the class CSCE 464 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
I currently refer to it as a "Japanese Particle Practice Tool."

<h2>About Japanese Particles, and why they're important to practice</h2>

Particles in Japanese are essentialy sufffixes that immediately follow (or percede) nouns, verbs, adjectives, or even whole sentences.
Like in English, suffixes are incredibly important to master in order to consistently give the right context to whatever it is you wish to say.
Particularly for Japanese, there are particles that essentialy serve the same purpose (は and が, for example), but can really throw off your
sentence's context if you use them incorrectly. Such is why, if you wish to be fluent in Japanese, is it is very crucial you develop a deep comprehension
for when to use an appropriate particle in the appropriate context.

Furthermore, if you learn Japanese in a college classroom, like I have, every exam will have a section dedicated to figuring out missing particles.
These sections are ones I often miss most of my points on. For this reason, I was motivated to make a tool that could potentially improve my
comprehension with Japanese particles, and by proxy, the Japanese language overall.

<h2>Running this website on your own machine</h2>

I have <b>NOT</b> tried hosting this website anywhere besides my localhost. For this reason, if you wish to run my website on your own machine,
<b>YOU WILL NEED TO SET UP THE NODE.JS SERVER FOR SENTENCE_GENERATOR.MJS ON YOUR OWN.</b> Assuming you have Node.js already installed, all you
need to do is execute "node sentence_generator.js" in the website's root directory, and you'll be set.

Also, if you use MAMP to run my site, be sure you are in the "public" directory in the 'preferences' tab. Otherwise, the index.html won't be found.

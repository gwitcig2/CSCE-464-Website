        This webpage serves as an in-progress prototype for a Japanese particle practice tool. 
        It aims to help English-speaking Japanese learners improve their comphrehension with particle 
        utilization in the Japanese language. This is achieved via a quiz game format. Here's how it works: 
           <br><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will be given a random sentence in Japanese that has a randomly chosen particle missing.</li>
        <li>Use the context clues provided in the sentence to guess the missing particle.</li>
        <li>Getting a correct answer awards you one point, and you may move on to the next random sentence.</li>
        <li>A wrong answer will take away one of your lives, with no option to move on to a new sentence.</li>
        <li>You are given three, and only three lives. Losing them all means game over.</li>
        <li>Do your best to achieve the highest score you can get. There's no time limit, so do think critically!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br>There are also some important features this quiz game has that will help you along the way:<br><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may hover over a word in a sentence with your cursor (or tap it on mobile devices) to get an informational 
          tooltip about the word. Currently, these details include its romaji reading, and its pronounciation,
          which is written in Kana. There will eventually be a feature that shows the English translation of the word.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br>A beta form of the quiz game is currently available in the "example quiz" part of the navigation bar.
        When you're ready, feel free to put your particle comprehension to the test, and have fun while doing so!<br><br>

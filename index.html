        Welcome!<br><br>

      <p>
        This webpage currently serves as the "rough draft" for the potential design layout
        of a Japanese particle practice tool. It aims to help English-speaking Japanese learners
        improve their comphrehension with particle utilization in the Japanese language. I plan to have 
        the tool be a basic quiz game with useful accesibility features so that my target audience
        can get the utmost conveince out of this website. Some features I plan on adding include:<br><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A basic score and lives system</li>
        <li>Randomized Japanese sentences, and a randomly chosen particle in that sentence to find out</li>
        <li>Hovering over a word in a sentence displays useful information about that word (like a tooltip)</li>
        <li>Score multipliers (if the user's on a correct answer streak, etc.)</li>
        <li>Some sort of way to get your lives back</li>
        <li>Other settings, such as tooltip info and difficulty, that the user can control to their liking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br>I am 100% open to feedback for how to make any sort of improvements to my site, whether it's with the UI
        or with the quiz game itself. Thank you for checking out this little project.<br><br><br>
